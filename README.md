The official [MyST (Markedly Structured Text)](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io) Textmate grammar, and VS Code extension, for extending the markdown language.

This extension injects additional elements into the base markdown syntax highlighting grammar,
and adds additional language support for MyST specific elements.

**Important** This extension is a work in progress, and future changes are likely.

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting

Embedded code blocks/cells can be utilised in their native language:

### Hover and Autocompletion

Directive completion and hover is available for all built-in sphinx directives:

### Preview Enhancement

This extension enhances VS Code's built-in Markdown previewer
([see this guide for info](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/markdown-extension)),
to properly render nested admonitions, and code directives, etc.

If you encounter any issues with this, you can disable it
with the `myst.preview.enable` configuration option
(and please report it).

## Working with Markdown

Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux)
* Toggle preview (`Shift+CMD+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux)
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Space` (macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets

* [Markdown Syntax Reference](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)

## Contributing

The main grammar is stored in `syntaxes/myst.tmLanguage`. This file is generated from `myst.tmLanguage.base.yaml`.

See [this guide on textmate bundles](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars) and
[the VS Code guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide) for more help.

### Building the Grammar

The grammar is written as a [jinja template](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) YAML file,
with the templates and default variables stored in `template/`

To generate the main grammar with javascript:

```bash
$ npm ci
$ npm run compile
$ npm run build
```

or with python:

```bash
$ pip install yaml jinja2
$ python src/build.py
```

Snippets are also built in the same manner.

### Testing

To run the full test suite:

```bash
$ npm test
```

The test suite is split into 'integration' tests,
which require VS Code to be launched,
and 'standalone' tests,
which can be run in the standard fashion with [mocha](https://mochajs.org).

```bash
$ npm run pretest
$ node ./out/test/runIntergration.js
$ ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha --ui tdd out/test/standalone/
```

The highlighting test cases are stored as markdown files under `test_static/colorize-fixtures`.
Grammar test results are stored under `test_static/colorize-results`, which are automatically generated/updated from the fixtures.

To visualise the grammar in VS Code, select the `Launch Extension` configuration in the VS Code debugger and run.
To launch a development version of the extension in VS Code, press `F5`.

### Linting

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

and to auto-fix lints:

```bash
$ npm run lint:fix
```

### Publishing to VS Marketplace

The publishing of the package should be done *via* the Github Actions CI. To trigger a release, bump the version in `package.json`, and create a new release tag on Github
starting with `release`, e.g. `release-0.9.4`.
