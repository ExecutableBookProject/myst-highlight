[MyST (Markedly Structured Text)](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io) official Textmate grammar, and VS Code extension, for extending the markdown language.

This extension injects additional elements into the base markdown syntax highlighting grammar,
and will also highlight `.myst`, `.mystnb` and `.mnb` files.

**Important** This extension is still in alpha development, and may change in the future.

## Contributing

The main grammar is stored in `syntaxes/myst.tmLanguage`. This file is generated from `myst.tmLanguage.base.yaml`.

See [this guide on textmate bundles](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars) and
[the VS Code guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide) for more help.

### Building

The grammar is written as a [jinja template](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) YAML file,
with the templates and default variables stored in `template/`

To generate the main grammar with javascript:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

or with python:

```bash
$ pip install yaml jinja2
$ python build.py
```

### Testing

To launch a development version of the extension in VS Code, press `F5`.

To run the grammar tests:

```bash
$ npm run test
```

The test cases are stored as markdown files under `test/colorize-fixtures`. Grammar test results are stored under `test/colorize-results`, which are automatically generated from the fixtures.

To test the grammar in VS Code, select the `Launch Extension` configuration in the VS Code debugger and run.

### Publishing to VS Marketplace
